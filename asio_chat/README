In order to use the udpchatserver you could use netcat to simulate chat clients.
Launch netcat using:
"nc -u 127.0.0.1 2000"

Then inside netcat type:
- "R<clientname>"
-- to register as a client
-- <clientname> is a placeholder for any string that could be used as a unique client name
- "S<message>"
-- to send a message to all registered clients
-- <message> is a placeholder for any string that could be sent as chat message to all clients
